## Problems during the project
- Figuring out the structure of javascript logic (Eventually decided to have everything stored in objects)
- Tracking how to access the values of keys in different objects became a hassle as more keys and objects were being added throughout the project
- Figuring out logic for certain parts of the game became tricky since the difficulty with tracking how to catch certain values of keys only added to the problem
- An example is creating the function for how the game would catch any incorrect letters when the player might mispell the word that has to be guessed, 
the usage of a substring method helped but having to add many made it tricky to track the values for each condition that would call on it.
